This is a music composition software project meant to combine modularity of tonality (especially for microtonal tuning) and rhythm with a higher degree of accessibility.

In this repository I will be uploading release versions and source code for my project as well as documents and tutorials relating to microtonality, generative music algorithms, digital instrument design, etc. If you want a primer on the basics, I suggest you start with Theoretical_Introduction.pdf.
